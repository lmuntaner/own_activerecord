# Active Record Lite!

We created our own ActiveRecord.

We created some methods to be able to search in the database with simple queries.
Eventually we also created our own belongs_to and has_many methods.

I finished the project and went through the bonuses of has_one_through and has_many_through. Check the code in 
here. There are 3 different ways to do it: single query, using our own where methods or using belongs_to and has_many. The teacher assisstant told me that the best performance was the single query even though is the longest and the longest to read. But it makes sense since you are only querying the database once. I kept the rest of the ways as a reminder.
